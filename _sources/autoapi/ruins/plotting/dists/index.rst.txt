   Concept plot for PDFs of different events.
   This plot illustrates the interdependece of Kngihtian uncertainty
   and risk for a set of events. At least one event has to be passed.

   :param events: Each event is represented by a dict, that has to contain the following keys:
                  outcomes: List[Tuple[float, float]]
                      The mu and std of each outcome for this event
                  Additionally, the following keys are optional:
                  dist : str
                      The distribution of the event. Default is 'norm'.
                  coloscale : str
                      The colorscale used to color the events. Default is a
                      cycle through ['Greens', 'Reds', 'Blues']
                  name : str
                      Name for this event
   :type events: List
